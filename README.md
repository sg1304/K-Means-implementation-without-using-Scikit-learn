# K-Means-implementation-without-using-Scikit-learn
Implement the k-means clustering algorithm on Wisconsin breast cancer dataset without any inbuilt implementation. 

Apply the algorithm for k=2, using L1 and L2 distance measures. Check the purity of the clusters after the algorithm terminates, for both distance measures. 

Calculated the following metrics using L1 and L2 distance measures. 
    Average distance of the vector distances to the cluster mean, within each cluster. 
    Max distance to the cluster mean within each cluster. 
    Max distance between two feature vectors within each cluster. 

Repeat above for k=3 and k=4 and draw conclusions on the purity of each cluster. 

Tabulate the distance metrics in for k=2, k=3 and k=4 and draw conclusions
